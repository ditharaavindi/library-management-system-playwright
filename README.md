# üìö Library Management System

A comprehensive library management application with user authentication, book catalog management, and reservation system - demonstrating modern web development with end-to-end testing using Playwright.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This is a full-stack TypeScript application consisting of:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js API with TypeScript
- **Database**: JSON file storage (no external database required)
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E test suite with cross-browser support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd library-management-system-playwright

# Install all dependencies (root, frontend, and backend)
npm run setup

# This command will:
# - Install root dependencies
# - Install backend dependencies
# - Install frontend dependencies
# - Install Playwright browsers for testing
```

**Alternative: Manual Installation**

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev

# Or start individually:
npm run dev:backend    # Backend only (port 5001)
npm run dev:frontend   # Frontend only (port 3000)
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5001

### Default Users

The system comes with pre-configured users:

**Admin User:**

- Email: `admin@library.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Role: Administrator (can add/manage books)

**Regular User:**

- Email: `user@library.com`
- Password: `user123`
- Role: Member (can reserve books)

**Librarian:**

- Email: `librarian@library.com`
- Password: `librarian123`
- Role: Librarian (can manage reservations)

## üì± Using the Application

### User Authentication & Navigation

1. **Login**: Navigate to the homepage and you'll be redirected to the login page
2. **User Roles**: Different users have different capabilities:
   - **Members**: Browse books, make reservations, view their reservations
   - **Administrators**: All member features plus add new books
   - **Librarians**: Manage reservation approvals and view all reservations

### Book Management

1. **Browse Books**: View the complete book catalog with search and filtering
2. **Search**: Use the search bar to find books by title
3. **Book Details**: Click on any book to view detailed information
4. **Add Books** (Admin only): Use the "Add Book" feature to expand the catalog

### Reservation System

1. **Make Reservations**: Click "Reserve" on available books and set reservation period
2. **Reservation Period**: Users can specify how long they need the book (1-30 days)
3. **Track Status**: View reservation status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Completed, Returned)
4. **Librarian Dashboard**: Librarians can approve/reject reservations
5. **Return Management**: Librarians can mark books as returned and remove reservations
6. **My Reservations**: Members can view their reservation history with time periods

### Responsive Design

- The application works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Navigation adapts to screen size with mobile-friendly menus
- All features are accessible across different devices

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Guide

### Playwright E2E Test Suite

The project includes a comprehensive Playwright test suite with **47 test cases** covering all application functionality across multiple test files.

#### Quick Start Testing

```bash
# Run complete test suite
npm run test

# Run with UI mode for interactive testing
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:headed
```

#### Browser-Specific Testing

```bash
# Test on specific browsers
npm run test:chromium
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:webkit

# Test on all browsers in parallel
npm run test:all-browsers
```

#### Mobile & Responsive Testing

```bash
# Test mobile responsiveness
npm run test:mobile

# Test mobile responsiveness
npx playwright test --project="mobile"
```

#### Debug & Development Tools

```bash
# Generate tests interactively
npm run test:codegen

# Debug mode with step-through
npm run test:debug

# Run tests with trace collection
npx playwright test --trace=on

# Slow motion debugging
npx playwright test --project=debug
```

#### üé¨ Using Playwright Codegen (Test Generator)

Playwright Codegen automatically generates test code by recording your actions in the browser.

**Important:** Start your application first before running codegen!

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the application
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run codegen (in a new terminal)
npm run test:codegen
```

**What happens:**

1. Opens browser window at http://localhost:3000
2. Opens Playwright Inspector showing generated code
3. Records all your actions (clicks, typing, navigation)
4. Generates TypeScript test code automatically

**Example workflow:**

1. Codegen opens browser
2. Perform actions: Login ‚Üí Browse books ‚Üí Reserve book
3. Copy generated code from Playwright Inspector
4. Save to a test file and refine

**Advanced options:**

```bash
# Start from specific page
npx playwright codegen localhost:3000/login

# Use specific browser
npx playwright codegen localhost:3000 --browser=firefox

# Emulate mobile device
npx playwright codegen localhost:3000 --device="iPhone 14"

# Save directly to file
npx playwright codegen localhost:3000 --target typescript -o tests/new-test.spec.ts
```

**Common error:** If you get `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, make sure your app is running first with `npm run dev`.

#### Test Reports & Documentation

```bash
# Generate HTML report
npm run test:report

# View report in browser
npx playwright show-report

# Export JSON results
npx playwright test --reporter=json --output-file=results.json
```

## üí° Development Tips

### Playwright Best Practices

1. **Use auto-waiting** - Let Playwright handle timing automatically
2. **Write resilient selectors** - Prefer user-visible text over CSS selectors
3. **Test user flows** - Focus on real user scenarios
4. **Leverage debugging tools** - Use trace viewer and codegen
5. **Run tests in CI** - Ensure consistent test execution

### Configuration Options

```bash
# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/basic-functionality.spec.ts

# Run tests matching pattern
npx playwright test -g "login"

# Run with custom timeout
npx playwright test --timeout=60000

# Run with specific worker count
npx playwright test --workers=2

# Set base URL
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test

# Enable debug mode
DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 and 5001 are available
2. **Node version**: Use Node.js v16 or higher
3. **Dependencies**: Run `npm run setup` to install all packages
4. **Browser installation**: Playwright will auto-install browsers on first run

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check application health
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# View detailed test output
DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test

# Run tests with trace
npx playwright test --trace=on

# Show test report
npx playwright show-report
```
